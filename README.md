Retail Business Sales Performance Analytics Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

🧭 <ins>Project Objective</ins>

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a Sales Performance Analytics Dashboard that provides clear visibility of the company’s performance across different dimensions such as time, geography, customer segment, and product category.

The dashboard must enable management to:

- Monitor key performance metrics in real time

- Identify growth opportunities

- Detect declining performance areas

- Support strategic planning and business forecasting


🎯 <ins>Detailed Problem Statement</ins>

A multi-city retail business operating across major Indian regions including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad is experiencing rapid growth in its operations. However, the management currently lacks a centralized, data-driven view of business performance, making it difficult to track revenue patterns, identify profitable product lines, evaluate regional performance, and understand customer purchasing behavior.

Sales data is available, but it exists only in raw transactional format and contains issues such as inconsistencies, missing values, and lack of structured reporting. Due to this, leadership teams struggle to answer important business questions such as:

- Which regions and cities contribute the highest sales revenue?

- How is business performance changing month-over-month and year-over-year?

- Which product categories and subcategories generate maximum profit?

- Which customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Small Business) contribute most to revenue?

- What are the seasonal or time-based demand patterns?

- Are there performance declines in any regions or categories that require strategic action?

To enable data-driven decision-making, a complete analytical solution is required using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive reporting.
